--- PAGE 4 ---
Dear Shareholders,
Nearly	fifty	years	ago,	our	visionary	
founder,	Shri	Dhirubhai	Ambani,	
embarked on a bold mission — 
to	prove	that	India	could	build	a	
world-class	enterprise	founded	on	
innovation,	integrity,	and	ambition.	
That belief became Reliance. And 
over	the	decades,	Reliance	has	
grown	from	an	idea	into	one	of	the	
world’s	most	admired	enterprises	—	
a symbol of India’s entrepreneurial 
spirit and its limitless potential.
Shri. Mukesh D. Ambani
Chairman and Managing Director , 
Reliance Industries Limited
Today,	Reliance	is	not	just	a	company.	
It	is	a	national	institution	that	powers	
opportunity, progress, and prosperity 
for	1.45	billion	Indians.	Our	journey	has	
been extraordinary — transforming 
traditional industries, building global-
scale	capabilities,	creating	entirely	new	
markets,	and	touching	the	everyday	
lives	of	our	fellow	citizens.	But	we	have	
never	paused	to	celebrate	the	past.	
Instead, each milestone has inspired 
us	to	aim	higher,	work	harder,	and	lead	
with	purpose.
Adapting Boldly, Evolving 
Relentlessly
The	world	is	changing	at	breakneck	
speed — reshaped by digital disruption, 
global shifts, and technological 
breakthroughs.	At	Reliance,	we	see	this	
not as a challenge but as an opportunity. 
We are reimagining our future and 
reshaping our businesses to become 
a	new-age	deep-tech	enterprise.
From	energy	to	entertainment,	
from	retail	to	digital	services,	we	are	
integrating next-generation technologies 
across	every	business	vertical.	Over	
1,000	of	our	in-house	scientists	are	
leading cutting-edge research in areas 
like	AI,	renewable	energy,	advanced	
materials, and digital platforms. 
Our manufacturing infrastructure 
is being future-proofed to support 
India’s aspiration to become a 
global	manufacturing	powerhouse.	
This	evolution	mirrors	the	journey	of	our	
What is Good for India  
is Good for Reliance
CHAIRMAN AND MANAGING DIRECTOR’S ST A TEMENT
great nation as it steps confidently into 
the	Amrit	Kaal	—	a	transformative	era	on	
the	path	to	becoming	a	fully	developed	
‘Viksit	Bharat.’
India’s Moment. Reliance’s Resolve.
Today, India is standing tall on the global 
stage.	Despite	global	uncertainties	and	
geopolitical turbulence, our economy 
continues to demonstrate unmatched 
resilience	and	momentum.	In	FY25,	
India’s	GDP	growth	remained	nearly	
double	the	global	average	—	propelled	
by robust domestic consumption, 
infrastructure	development,	
thriving	exports,	and	a	dynamic	
digital ecosystem.
More	importantly,	India	is	no	longer	
just	following	trends	—	it	is	setting	
them.	From	UPI’s	global	success	to	the	
India	AI	Mission,	from	green	energy	to	
space tech, India is shaping the future. 
This is India’s moment. And Reliance 
is	proud	to	walk	shoulder-to-shoulder	
with	the	nation	—	as	a	committed	
partner,	a	responsible	value-creator,	
and	a	technology-driven	enabler	of	
inclusive	growth.
Strong and Resilient Performance
Even	amidst	external	volatility,	Reliance	
delivered	a	year	of	solid	and	balanced	
growth.	Our	results	speak	to	the	
strength	of	our	diversified	model	and	our	
deep-rooted execution discipline:
• Revenue: ₹10,71,174	crore	(+7.1%	Y-o-Y)
• EBITDA: ₹1,83,422	crore	(+2.9%	Y-o-Y)
• Net Profit: ₹81,309	crore	(+2.9%	Y-o-Y)
Each	business	played	a	vital	role	in	
this performance:
• Retail:	Crossed	₹3,30,000	crore	in	
turnover	and	expanded	its	footprint	
to	19,340	stores,	strengthening	its	
leadership in Indian Retail industry.
• Digital Services: Jio emerged as the 
world’s	largest	data	network	with	488	
million	users,	including	191	million	
on	5G.
• Media:	Built	a	large	and	distinctive	
media institution, in partnership 
with	Disney,	across	genres,	marking	
the	beginning	of	a	new	era	in	India’s	
entertainment	landscape.	Delivered	
record	viewership	and	engagement	
metrics	within	the	first	few	months	of	
commencing operations.
• Oil to Chemicals (O2C): 
Demonstrated	resilience	through	
disciplined cost management and 
strong domestic placement.
• Oil & Gas:	Delivered	record	EBITDA,	
with	increased	output	from	KG-D6	
and	CBM	blocks,	enhancing	India’s	
energy independence.
• New Energy:	Transitioned	from	vision	
to execution — operationalising 
giga-scale solar and battery 
energy	projects.
Creating the Future — Four New 
Engines of Growth
As	Reliance	approaches	its	Golden	
Jubilee,	we	have	built	high-powered	
growth	engines:	Retail, Digital Services, 
Media and Entertainment, and 
New Energy.	Each	of	these	platforms	
is	technology-first,	innovation-led,	
and positioned to disrupt industries 
while	delivering	massive	value	to	Indian	
consumers and the global market.
Our	O2C	and	Oil	and	Gas	businesses	will	
continue	to	grow	while	catering	to	India’s	
rising energy and materials demand.
We	are	not	just	scaling	businesses	
—	we	are	building	platforms	that	
empower	people,	reduce	inequality,	
drive	sustainability,	and	elevate	India’s	
position in the global economy. Whether 
it’s	transforming	the	way	Indians	shop,	
consume	data,	watch	content,	or	power	
their homes and businesses — Reliance 
is	shaping	the	future	with	purpose	
and	conviction.
Our Foundation — Values, People, 
Vision
At the heart of Reliance’s success is 
a	foundation	built	on	values,	trust,	
and talent. Our strong balance sheet, 
relentless	focus	on	productivity,	and	
unwavering	commitment	to	excellence	
give	us	the	confidence	to	embrace	
bold ambitions.
Our	people	—	across	every	function	and	
business — bring passion, ingenuity, 
and	integrity	to	their	work	every	day.	
Our	Board	provides	the	stewardship	
and	wisdom	that	guides	our	long-term	
decisions.	Our	partners	and	vendors	align	
closely	with	our	purpose.	And	above	all,	
our customers and shareholders place 
their trust in us — time and again — and 
that is our greatest strength.
Thank Y ou for Believing in Us
To	each	of	you	—	our	valued	
shareholders — I express my deepest 
gratitude.	Your	unwavering	belief	in	
Reliance’s	vision	gives	us	the	courage	to	
keep pushing boundaries and building 
for the future.
The	journey	ahead	is	full	of	promise.	With	
unwavering	faith	in	India	and	steadfast	
commitment	to	innovation,	sustainability	
and inclusion, Reliance is poised to rise 
to	even	greater	heights.	For	India	and	for	
Reliance - the future shines bright!
With	warm	regards,

Operating Environment
Global	economic	growth	remained	
healthy	at	3.3%	in	CY24	consistent	with	
the	prior	year.	Global	inflation	eased	
to	5.7%	in	CY24	from	6.7%	in	CY23,	
supported by the stabilisation of supply 
chains	post-COVID	and	a	moderation	in	
commodity	prices.	This	enabled	major	
central banks to ease monetary policy, 
lowering	benchmark	rates	by	50	to	100	
bps	in	CY24.
However,	geopolitical	tension	and	policy	
uncertainties, including trade tariffs, led 
to	volatility	in	global	markets,	adversely	
impacting energy demand, resulting 
in	softer	prices	and	narrower	margins.	
Transportation fuel margins moderated 
from	elevated	levels,	and	downstream	
chemicals margins came under 
significant pressure due to incremental 
supply	additions,	particularly	from	China.
Despite	global	headwinds,	the	Indian	
economy	was	remarkably	resilient.	
While	growth	moderated	to	6.5%	in	
FY	2024-25	from	9.2%	in	FY	2023-24,	
India retained its position as the fastest 
growing	major	economy	in	the	world.
Domestic	consumption	witnessed	
mixed	trends	with	rural	demand	
strengthening, and urban consumption 
moderating.	Macro-prudential	regulatory	
tightening	of	credit	in	FY	2023-24	led	
to	moderation	in	personal	credit	growth	
to	16%	in	FY	2024-25,	from	27%	in	
FY	2023-24.	Consumption	demand	
remained	relatively	soft	during	the	
first	half	with	general	elections	and	
peak	monsoon.	The	festive	season	and	
Mahakumbh	revived	domestic	markets	
in	the	second	half.	However,	pockets	
of urban and rural demand are yet to 
fully	recover.
External	balances	in	India	saw	continued	
strength	in	current	account	with	resilient	
services	surplus	(current	account	deficit	
<1%	of	GDP).	Net	services	exports	
clocked	another	14%	Y-o-Y	growth,	
driven	by	continued	momentum	in	digital	
services	and	Global	Capability	Centres	
Financial Performance and Review
(GCC).	In	the	second	half,	capital	inflows	
slowed	as	FPIs	turned	net	sellers,	leading	
to	tighter	liquidity.	In	response,	the	RBI	
cut	the	CRR	by	50	bps	in	December,	and	
subsequently reduced the policy repo 
rate	by	a	cumulative	100	bps	to	5.5%	by	
June	2025.	India	remains	well	positioned	
for	sustained	high	growth	on	the	back	
of	favourable	demographics	and	a	large	
domestic market.
Performance Overview
Reliance	Industries	Limited	delivered	a	
resilient	performance	for	FY	2024-25,	
emphasising the strength of its India-
focused,	diverse	business	portfolio.	
Amidst	prolonged	global	volatility,	
the	Company	delivered	balanced	and	
consistent	growth	across	its	businesses.
• Consolidated	revenue	increased	by	
7.1%	to	₹10,71,174	crore	(US$	125.3	
billion), compared to ₹10,00,122	crore	
in	FY	2023-24
• EBITDA	grew	by	2.9%	to	₹1,83,422	
crore	(US$	21.5	billion)	from	₹1,78,290	
crore	in	the	previous	year,	with	
consumer businesses contributing 
over	50%	of	consolidated	EBITDA
• PAT	rose	2.9%	year-on-year	to	
₹81,309	crore	(US$	9.5	billion)
Segment	Performance:
• Digital	Services	EBITDA	grew	14.7%	
supported	by	widespread	adoption	
of	5G	and	broadband	across	mobility,	
home, and enterprise segments. Tariff 
revision	introduced	during	the	year	
was	well	absorbed,	with	no	adverse	
impact on data consumption trends.
• Retail	EBITDA	grew	8.6%,	benefitting	
from	productivity	gains	through	
network	optimisation	and	improved	
operating metrics
• Oil	and	Gas	EBITDA	increased	by	4.9%	
supported by a marginal increase in 
production	from	the	KG	D6	block
• Oil	to	Chemicals	(O2C)	EBITDA	
declined	by	11.9%,	impacted	
by	weaker	fuel	cracks	and	lower	
petrochemical margins. The 
performance	was	supported	by	
stronger domestic demand and 
feedstock flexibility. The segment 
witness	increased	fuel	retail	sales	
through	Jio-bp,	aided	by	a	favourable	
margin	environment.
• Consolidated	cash	profit	increased	
to ₹1,46,917	crore,	compared	to	
₹1,41,969	crore	in	FY	2023-24.
Consolidated Net Debt
RIL’s	gross	debt	as	on	31st	Mar’25	stood	
at ₹3,47,530	crore	(US$	40.7	billion)	
Net debt stood at ₹1,17,083	crore	
(US$	13.7	billion).	Robust	internal	cash-
flow	generation	supported	investments	
in	growth	opportunities	across	business,	
while	maintaining	a	conservative	
balance	sheet	and	investment	grade	
credit ratings.
Capex
Capital	expenditure	for	the	financial	
year stood at ₹1,31,107	crore	(US$	
15.3	billion),	adequately	covered	
by	cash	profits.	FY	2023-24	capex	
was	at	₹1,31,769	crore.	FY	2024-25	
investments	were	largely	directed	
towards	new	O2C	projects,	Retail	
store	expansion,	augmenting	Digital	
Services	infrastructure	and	building	
manufacturing	assets	in	New	Energy.
Standalone
Standalone	RIL	revenue	was	at	
₹5,57,163	crore	(US$	65.2	billion),	lower	
by	3.1%	as	compared	to	₹5,74,956	
crore	in	FY	2023-24.	EBITDA	for	the	
standalone	entity	fell	14.2%	to	₹74,163	
crore	(US$	8.7	billion)	from	₹86,393	
crore	for	the	year	ago	period.	The	O2C	
segment	profitability	was	impacted	by	
unfavourable	global	demand-supply	
balance,	which	was	partially	offset	by	
improved	upstream	performance	with	
higher	volumes	of	gas	and	condensate.	
Standalone	Profit	After	Tax	was	at	
₹35,262	crore	(US$	4.1	billion),	down	
16.1%	vis-a-vis	₹42,042	crore	last	year.
